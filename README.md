  Face Recognition Brain's API
</h1>

This is the API of the [Face Recognition Brain Application](https://github.com/RayBDev/FaceRecognitionApp).

## :bookmark_tabs: Technologies Used

1.  **NodeJS + PostgreSQL**

    NodeJS was used for the signin, register and user info endpoints. PostgreSQL allowed for better database segmentation due to its relational nature.

4. **Heroku**

    The application is hosted on Heroku due to its backend requirements.
